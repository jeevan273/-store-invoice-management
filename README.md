Invoice management is an internal business function responsible for managing documents from vendors or suppliers. Invoices represent a source document in accounting. Source documents outline specific information relating to a financial transaction. Vendors usually provide outside services such as maintenance, utilities, office supplies, or advertising to businesses. Suppliers represent companies who provide businesses with economic resources. Economic resources include the raw materials and direct labor needed to produce consumer goods or services. Companies use invoice management processes to ensure vendors and suppliers receive payment in a timely manner.
